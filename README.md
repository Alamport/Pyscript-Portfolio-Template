Welcome to creating your personal website that will showcase the various
projects that you will make throughout your two-week session. 

We have given you a basic template to help guide you at the beginning, 
but we encourage you to make changes and add more features to touch up 
on it!

There might be a lot to look through when going through the HTML and CSS
file, so use this as a guide on what to do first. And of course, if you 
have any further questions, feel free to ask us:

1) Run the program to see how the site looks
2) Go through the index.html file and find instances where "TODO" is 
    written and replace the generic text 
    ("CTRL F"/ "Cmnd F"and search "TODO")
3) Add another "<article>" section in the portfolio portion 
    so you can add your second project there 
4) See if you can add a third "<article>" section by asking ChatGPT
5) Read through the "style.css" file and get familiar with the content

There is a lot more you can add to your site, so search around and see 
what you might want to add! If you are not sure at the moment, 
try finding some random sites and see if there are aspects that you
want to incorporate.
